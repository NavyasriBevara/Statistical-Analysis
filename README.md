# Statistical-Analysis

# Summary:

The document titled "Statistical Analysis in Python with Datasets" provides a comprehensive guide on performing statistical analysis using Python. It covers various aspects of descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as regression analysis, all demonstrated with code snippets and output examples.

1. Introduction to Python Libraries:
The document begins by importing essential Python libraries required for statistical analysis:
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.
SciPy: For scientific and technical computing, especially statistical functions.
Statsmodels: For estimating and testing statistical models.
Warnings are also filtered to avoid unnecessary output clutter.
2. Dataset Overview:
The dataset used in the document is loaded using Pandas. It contains several columns: AGE, SEX, BMI, STUDENTS, SMOKING, and FINE.
The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to give an initial view of the data.
3. Descriptive Statistics:
Mean: The document calculates the mean (average) for each column.
Median: It also computes the median, which represents the middle value when the data is sorted.
Mode: The mode, or the most frequent value in the dataset, is identified for each column.
Variance: The variance for each column is calculated, showing the spread of the data points around the mean.
Standard Deviation: This is the square root of the variance and provides insight into the data's dispersion.
Kurtosis: Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the data distribution.
Skewness: Skewness indicates the asymmetry of the data distribution.
Range: The range is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in each column.
4. Inferential Statistics:
T-Test:
A one-sample T-test is conducted on the BMI column, comparing it to a population mean of 0.03.
The results indicate a significant difference, with a very high T-statistic and a P-value of 0.0, meaning the observed mean is significantly different from 0.03.
Confidence Intervals:
A 95% confidence interval for the BMI is calculated, giving a range in which the true mean of the population is likely to fall.
5. Regression Analysis:
Simple Linear Regression:
The document fits a simple linear regression model to predict the FINE column based on BMI.
The regression model summary includes:
R-squared value: Indicates the proportion of variance in FINE explained by BMI. An R-squared of 0.039 suggests a weak relationship.
Coefficients: The slope coefficient for BMI is 393.87, indicating that for every unit increase in BMI, the FINE increases by this amount on average.
P-value: The P-value associated with BMI is 0.000, showing the relationship is statistically significant.
Model Fit Statistics: The model includes other statistics like F-statistic, Durbin-Watson, and others to assess the fit and reliability of the model.
6. Summary and Interpretation:
The document demonstrates how to perform and interpret various statistical analyses using Python.
The focus is on providing a practical approach, with each step illustrated through Python code and output.
It highlights the importance of both descriptive and inferential statistics in understanding and modeling data.
7. Applications:
The techniques demonstrated are applicable in various fields where data analysis is crucial, such as healthcare (as indicated by the dataset related to health metrics), economics, social sciences, and more.
By following the steps in the document, users can apply similar methods to their datasets to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models.
In essence, the document serves as a practical guide for anyone interested in performing statistical analysis using Python, covering both basic and advanced topics.
